# Sir, can you print more money?
is a comedic economy simulator set in medieval time, where you will balance the life of your knights, farmers and royalty in order to gather a ton of trophies and build a spaceship.
    
 - Manage your economy: set up salaries, taxes and print money!
 - Fight with snails: protect your land from the hoards of snails and earn trophies in expeditions!
 - Invent space travel and send your first spaceship, because this is how strategy games usually end!
 - Official hard mode: drink every time you see a clich√©!

The game is made in November 2022 for a GitHub Game Off 2022.
